To my replacement:

If you're reading this, you have the unfortunate job of taking over IT responsibilities
from me here at Callahan Auto.  HAHAHAHAHAAH! SUCKER!  This is the worst job ever!  You'll be
surrounded by stupid monkeys all day who can barely hit Ctrl+P and wouldn't know a fax machine
from a flame thrower!

Anyway I'm not completely without mercy.  There's a subfolder called "NickIzL33t" on this server
somewhere. I used it as my personal dropbox on the company's dime for years.  Heh. LOL.
I cleaned it out (no naughty pix for you!) but if you need a place to dump stuff that you want
to look at on your phone later, consider that folder my gift to you.

Oh by the way, Big Tom's a moron and always forgets his passwords and so I made an encrypted
.zip of his passwords and put them in the "NickIzL33t" folder as well.  But guess what?
He always forgets THAT password as well.  Luckily I'm a nice guy and left him a hint sheet.

Good luck, schmuck!

LOL.
